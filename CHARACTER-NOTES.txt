CY NM
Hit-and-run attackers.

All abilities deal a lot of damage, but most cooldowns are rather long.
(AFDS)

NM can take more damage, so NM dashes in and enemies start attacking NM.
Then CY dashes in, and NM can use his close range claw attack before CY
teleports both to safety while cooldowns refresh.
------------------------------
EH JT
Distract and eliminate attackers

EH has local area abilities, and JT excels in high damage ranged abilities.
(ASD)

EH can charge and temporarily incapacitate all enemies while JT eliminates
enemies one by one from afar.
------------------------------
CK CM
Kiters

High damage dealers who can always stay out of enemy range
(ADSF)

Both have one ranged ability and one ability to increase range between
themselves and the enemy so they only need to stay out of enemy range.
------------------------------
HV HQ
Daredevil close-range bursts

High damage dealers with little health but temporary invincibility.
(FADS)

HQ can grant both invincibility long enough for them to use close range abilities,
then running away.
------------------------------
KH PG
Enemy positioning controller

Enemy position control and local damager.
(FDSA)

PG can control how many enemies are around the team, and KH can
damage nearby enemies.
------------------------------
CC VC

------------------------------
CY AG
DPS and peeler.

CY deals great damage but is rather slow. AG can keep enemies away from CY.
(ASDF)

Basically CY uses abilities and when enemies get in dangerous range, AG keeps
them under control and from getting too close.

TJ but CP can reduce the damage with charm. CP can then eliminate enemies
while TJ is sleeping
